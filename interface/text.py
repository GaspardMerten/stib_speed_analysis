# üöå STIB Speed Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **STIB Speed Analysis Dashboard**, a powerful tool developed in collaboration with the CoDE lab at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles as part of the Brussels Mobility Twin umbrella project. 

This dashboard exploits open-source data from STIB-MIVB (https://stibmivb.opendatasoft.com). The data is then stored in the **MobilityTwin.Brussels** platform (as well a many other data sources, such as DeLijn, Lime, Tec, ...).

The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights into the speed of STIB vehicles across the Brussels region. More details
on our methodology can be found below, but first, let's get started!


### üöç How to use this dashboard:

#### Focus

By going to the tab on the left called **Focus**, you can select a specific line and direction to analyze the speed of vehicles over a specific time period and specific interstops.
 You can also filter the data by time periods, days of the week, and exclude certain periods like holidays (nl, fr, both, ...).
 
You can also specify multiple periods to compare the speed of vehicles during different time frames. For instance,
it is possible to compare the evolution of line 60 for the same period in 2023 and 2024.

By focusing on specific interstops, you can analyse patterns, detect trends, and better understand how changes in road structure, traffic, or other factors impact vehicle speeds.

This tab should allow to quickly retrieve analysis on specific interstops, lines, and directions, instead of having to manually ask STIB for the data.

#### Insights

*Currently under development*

The **Insights** tab provides a high-level overview of the data, including average speeds, time between stops, and other key metrics. This tab is useful for quickly understanding the overall performance of a line or direction.

#### Trips

*Currently under development*

The **Trips** tab allows you to visualize the trips of STIB vehicles over a specific time period across all lines. It is a visual representation of an experiment to retrieve identifier for vehicles in the STIB open-data, as STIB-MIVB removes
the vehicle identifier from the data, an unusual practice in the public transport sector. We are hence working on a solution to retrieve it, to further
enhance the capabilities of this dashboard.


### üìÉ Methodology


We believe that a clear methodology is key to understanding the data and the insights that can be drawn from it. Data can only be truly valuable when it is transparent and reproducible. Below, we provide a detailed explanation of how we calculate the speed of STIB vehicles.

As there are no identifiers for vehicles in the STIB open data, we have developed a methodology to calculate the speed of vehicles based on the distance between stops and the time between two consecutive points.

As we do not have vehicle's identifiers, we only consider segment for which there is only one vehicle present at both t=0s and t=20s. Moreover, we conider the interstop starting at the moment the bus arrives at the first stop and ending when the bus reaches the next stop - due to data constraints.

The speed is then calculated by dividing the distance delta by the time delta. This approach allows us to calculate the speed of vehicles across the STIB network, providing insights into the performance of the public transport system.

We then aggregate the data to provide average speeds, time between stops, and other key metrics for each line, direction, and interstop. This data is then visualized in the dashboard, allowing users to explore the data and draw their own conclusions.

     #### Speed computation mode
     <p>The speed computation mode is used to filter the results based on the speed computed. The speed is computed
     using the evolution of the distance from the last stop and the time between two consecutive points. This data is
     refreshed every 20 seconds, meaning some uncertainties can be present in the results, particularly when the
        vehicle is stopped. The following modes are available: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed >= 0</strong>: (VICOM) This mode will include all the results where the speed is greater or equal to 0.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed >= 0 but not 0 if close to stop</strong>: (VICOM without time at stop)    This mode will include all the results where the speed is greater or equal to 0, but not 0 if the stop is close to the stop.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed > 0</strong>: This mode will include all the results where the speed is greater than 0.</li>
        </ul>
        The first one is the most pessimistic, the last one is the most optimistic.<br><br>

    <p>
        Unlike De Lijn, TEC, and most other public transport systems using the GTFS-RealTime format 
        (accessible via Google Maps), STIB does not provide open-access data on vehicle speed or 
        detailed position tracking. Instead, STIB supplies only the distance in meters from the last stop 
        for each vehicle every 20 seconds, without vehicle identifiers.
    </p>

    <h4>Calculating Speed</h4>
    <p>
        Due to the absence of identifiers, speed can only be calculated under specific conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A single bus must be present on a interstop at both <code>t=0s</code> and <code>t=20s</code>.</li>
        <li>The distance delta (change in distance) must be non-negative, ensuring it is not a new bus entering 
            or an existing one leaving the segment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Speed is then derived by dividing the distance delta by the time delta. While this approach reduces the 
        number of usable data points, using a 15-minute data window ensures consistent speed calculations across the STIB network.
    </p>

    <h4>Limitations and Opportunities</h4>
    <p>
        The lack of vehicle identifiers poses a significant limitation. If STIB provided identifiers, as many other 
        companies do without GDPR concerns, speed calculations could be significantly more accurate.
    </p>

    <h4>Interstop Speed Averaging</h4>
    <p>
        The last stop ID is used to assign a interstop to each point. This ID updates when the bus reaches the next stop. 
        However, because data arrives every 20 seconds, the same stop ID can appear for multiple points, causing minor 
        discrep ancies in speed calculations. These discrepancies average out over longer intervals, meaning the speed for 
        a interstop represents the average speed from when the bus arrives at the start stop to when it reaches the end stop.
    </p>
    <h4>No data for underground stops</h4>
    <p>
        Due to the lack of network coverage, no data is available for underground stops, or too little to apply the 
        previous explained methodology. Hence, metros, some trams, and occasional buses interstops are not included in 
        the analysis.
